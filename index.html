                        fa&shy;ther to pursue a life at sea, and eventually becomes the captain of a

                        inquiring in the village he learns of As&shy;sol's dream and sets about to make

                        I have a "Scarlet sails" — the story of the captain and the girl. I found out how 
                        it hap&shy;pened, by chance, I stopped at the window with toys and saw a boat with 
                        the sharp  sail of white silk. This toy I said some&shy;thing, but I didn't know 
                        that, then I fig&shy;ured,  can you tell more sail red, but better than the scarlet, 
                        because scarlet is a bright jubilation. Jubilation means knowing why glad. And so,
                        expanding out, taking the waves  and the ship with scarlet sails, I saw the purpose 
                        of his exis&shy;tence.

                        This story about a girl Assol who lost her moth&shy;er when she was only five 
                        months. Assol  lived with their father, a sailor. After retire&shy;ment he began to 
                        make toys to earn and  lit&shy;tle daugh&shy;ter to life. Once in the forest, during 
                        the "chase" for uplyvshih yacht toy,  Assol encounters a "collector of songs, 
                        legends, tales and fairy tales"; the old man  named Aigle. He tells her that when 
                        she grows up and becomes an adult, it will one day come a Prince on a ship with 
                        scarlet sails.

                            I don't know how many years will pass, but a fairy-tale will blossom in Kaperna 
                            and will remain in the minds of the people for long. You'll be grown-up then, 
                            As&shy;sol.
                            One morning a crim&shy;son sail will gleam in the sun on the far horizon. The 
                            shimmering pile of crim&shy;son sails on a white ship will head straight to&shy;
                            wards you, cutting through the waves. This wonderful ship will sail in si&shy;
                            lently; there will be no shout&shy;ing or salvoes; a great crowd will 
                            gath&shy;er on the beach. Ev&shy;eryone will be amazed and astounded; and you'll 
                            be there, too. 
                            The ship will sail majes&shy;tically up to the very shore to the strains of 
                            beautiful mu&shy;sic; a swift boat decked out in rugs, flowers and gold will be 
                            lowered from the ship. "Why have you come? Whom are you search&shy;ing for?" the 
                            people on the Biche will say. Then you'll see a brave and handsome prince; 
                            he'll be standing there and stretch&shy;ing forth his  to&shy;wards you. 
                            "Hello, As&shy;sol!" he'll say. "Far, far away from here I saw you in a dream 
                            and have come to take you away to my kingdom for&shy;ev&shy;er. 
                            You will live with me there in a deep rose valley. You shall have ev&shy;ery&shy;
                            thing your heart desires; we shall be so happy togeth&shy;er your soul will 
                            nev&shy;er know the meaning of tears or sadness." He'll take you into his boat, 
                            bring you to the ship, and you'll sail away for&shy;ev&shy;er to a glo&shy;rious 
                            land where the sun comes up and where the stars will de&shy;scend from the sky 
                            to greet you upon your arrival.

                        We shall leave them now, knowing that they should be alone. There are  many words 
                        in the many languages and dialects of the world, but none of them  can even faintly 
                        convey that which they said to each oth&shy;er that day.

                                    Nev&shy;er before had a large ship approached this shore; the ship had 
                                    the very same sails whose colour sounded like a taunt; now they were 
                                    blazing brightly and incon&shy;testably with the inno&shy;cence of a 
                                    fact that refutes all the laws of be&shy;ing and common sense. Men, 
                                    women and chil&shy;dren were rac&shy;ing helter-skelter to&shy;wards the 
                                    shore; the inhab&shy;i&shy;tants shouted to each oth&shy;er over their 
                                    fences,  bumped into each oth&shy;er, howled and tumbled; soon a crowd
